**Project status**: starting.

**Puppeteer++** is a video game intended to help students to learn abstract concepts of C++ by using a metaphor with more familiar concepts: a theater of puppets.

C++ is a mandatory programming language for computer science students, but it is not intended for programming learning, therefore it normally becomes a daunting experience for students. One of the most misunderstood topics of C++ is the concept of pointer and memory management. Its difficulty is mainly due to the impossibility of the student of visualize the data structures into the computer memory. Therefore the student must abstract or imagine these concepts. Most of the strategies to build any program in C++ require pointers, such as polymorphism and generic containers. Therefore, if the student does not have a good understanding of this concept, his/her learning of C++ will be very limited and frustrating.

Puppeteer++ is a video game where C++ concepts are illustrated by a puppet theater metaphor. An execution thread is the puppeteer, a puppet is an object allocated in dynamic heap segment (the scenery), the puppeteer manages the puppet through a pointer represented by strings, and so on.

In this game the player (the C++ student) write the scripts (librettos) for a theater play. The puppeteer follows this libretto literally. But the puppeteer does not understand English or Spanish, the puppeteer *does speak C++*...

Puppeteer++ is developed by Jeisson Hidalgo-Céspedes, under a research project of [Centro de Investigaciones en Tecnologías de la Información y Comunicación](http://www.citic.ucr.ac.cr/) (CITIC) of [Universidad de Costa Rica](http://www.ucr.ac.cr/). It is licensed under GPL v2. More information:

- [API documentation](doc/api/)
- [Project oficial web page at CITIC](http://www.citic.ucr.ac.cr/proyecto/incentivo_lenguaje_programacion_en_estudiantes) (in Spanish)

Developers: Puppeteer++ is a multi-platform video game built over [Cocos2d-x](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/) v3. Instructions about setting up the development environment can be found in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.
